    <h1>🌟 My Journey as an SMA Warrior</h1>
    <p>By <strong>Murali S B</strong></p>

    <p>I’m <strong>Murali S B</strong>, a 23-year-old living with <strong>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3</strong> — a rare genetic condition that affects muscle strength and mobility.</p>

    <p>My journey with SMA began when I was about 18 months old. My parents noticed that I often fell after walking short distances and found it difficult to stand up from the floor. After several medical consultations and a muscle biopsy, we received the diagnosis — <strong>Spinal Muscular Atrophy</strong>.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>The doctors told my parents that I might not live beyond my teenage years. They warned that I would gradually lose my strength, become wheelchair-bound, and eventually bedridden. Hearing those words devastated my family. My parents spent countless nights crying and questioning why such a fate had befallen their children.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Despite visiting many hospitals, most doctors said there was no cure. Hope slowly faded — until we met an angel, <strong>Dr. Ann Agnes Mathew</strong>. She encouraged us not to give up, assuring my parents that children with SMA can lead normal, fulfilling lives. She also told us about a treatment called <strong>Spinraza</strong>, which helps maintain muscle strength and improve quality of life. That conversation reignited our faith and optimism.</p>

    <p>Even when others advised my parents not to send me to school, they believed in me and encouraged me to study. With their unwavering support, I pursued education with dedication and determination.</p>

    <h2>🏆 My Academic Journey</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📘 Scored 92% in SSLC</li>
      <li>🎓 Achieved 95.3% in PUC</li>
      <li>💼 Completed B.Com with a 9.4 CGPA</li>
      <li>🎯 Earned my Post-Graduation in Commerce</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I live in a small rural village near Bengaluru with my loving parents and elder sister Monisha, who is also an SMA warrior. My father and mother are both government primary-school teachers, and my sister works as a Village Administrative Officer in the Revenue Department.</p>

    <p>While pursuing my master’s degree, I cleared both <strong>KSET</strong> and <strong>UGC-NET</strong> on my very first attempt. Later, I was placed at <strong>Deloitte</strong> as a Tax Consultant — a dream come true and one of the proudest milestones of my life.</p>

    <p>I currently live in Hyderabad, staying independently with my cousin, and continue to follow my passions for finance, learning, and inspiring others through my journey.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>My story is proof that <strong>disability is not inability</strong> — with courage, perseverance, and the right support, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our dreams.</p>
